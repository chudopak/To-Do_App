# To-Do App
To-do list apps are one of the most popular types of app so I decided to make my own >)


## Functionality
The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then put checkmark near these items 
once you’re done with them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make
the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.

This App has five different screens. They built on top of the **Table View Controller's** and **Navigation Controller's**. One of them built just by coding (no **table view cells** added from *objects library*), two of them built by using **prototype cells** and other two screens made by using **static cells**.
